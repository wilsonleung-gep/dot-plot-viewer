Introduction
============

Developed by the [Genomics Education Partnership](https://thegep.org), the [*Dot
Plot Viewer*](https://gander.wustl.edu/%7ewilson/dotplotviewer/index.html) is an
utility used by the [*Gene Model
Checker*](https://gander.wustl.edu/%7ewilson/genechecker/index.html) to
construct a dot plot comparing two protein sequences. The *Dot Plot Viewer*
allows users to control the alignment parameters (e.g., scoring matrix, word
size, and neighborhood) in order to alter the sensitivity and specificity of the
dot plot.

Please see the "Examine the dot plot and alignment of our gene model against the
*D. melanogaster* ortholog" section of the [*Gene Model Checker* User
Guide](https://community.gep.wustl.edu/repository/documentations/Gene_Model_Checker_User_Guide.pdf)
for details.



Availability
============

The [*Dot Plot
Viewer*](https://gander.wustl.edu/%7ewilson/dotplotviewer/index.html) is
available through the "Dot Plot" tab of the [*Gene Model
Checker*](https://gander.wustl.edu/%7ewilson/genechecker/index.html). The *Gene
Model Checker* is available under the "**Resources & Tools**" section of the [F
Element project page](https://thegep.org/felement/) and the [Pathways project
page](https://thegep.org/pathways/) on the GEP website.
